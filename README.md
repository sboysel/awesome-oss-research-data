# Awesome Open Source Software Research Data [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

This is a (curated) list of empirical research in the space of Open Source Software.  We
prioritize studies in which the raw data is made publicly accessible but also
include research in which only high level insights are available.

An excellent list of datasets used for empirical software engineering / mining software repositories exists at
[dspinellis/awesome-msr](https://github.com/dspinellis/awesome-msr). Several relevant data sources from this list are included here.
